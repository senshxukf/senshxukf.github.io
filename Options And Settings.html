            <p> This is the general controls of the game.
                The movement consists of using WSAD, with the shooting button being F.
                the way you aim is by using the mouse button for your wizard to target his shots.
                The enemies will continuosly spawn around the cauldron getting increasingly faster,
                until your health reaches zero.<br></br>
                Story: You, a young wizard, has been given the responsibility to guard the sacred cauldron of the grand wizards.
                Just as you are given these instructions, enemies start to swarm the cauldron, hoping to destroy it so no one in your
                race has access to your power again. Armed with a simple fire spell, it's your job to defend the cauldron for as long as possible,
                until you are ultimately overrun and forced to watch as the cauldron gets destroyed.
